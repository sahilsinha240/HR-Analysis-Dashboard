# HR-Analysis-Dashboard
<h2>Introduction<h2>
<h4>I used Powerbi dashboard to analyze the company's HR details and also to learn more about its features. I found YouTube to be a great resource to understand the workings of Powerbi and successfully implemented it for the HR Analysis. This analysis enabled us to gain valuable insights from the data and make informed decisions that have helped in improving our business operations.<h4>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Step 1:- Cards</h3>
<h4>First, I used the Card to find the total number of Employee, Attrition, Active Employee and Average age<h4>
<h3>Step 2:- Condition in Card</h3>
<h4>After finding the Attrition rate using conditional statements, I analyzed the Attrition rate in the card.<h4>
<h3>Step 3:- Stacked Column Chart and Pie Chart</h3>
<h4>In a stacked column chart I visualizes No. of Employees by Age groups and in a pie chart I visualizes Department Wise Attrition.<h4>
<h3>Step 4:- Matrix</h3>
<h4>Visualized Job Satisfaction Rating using a matrix visualization.<h4>
<h3>Step 5:- Stacked Bar Chart</h3>
<h4>In a Stacked Bar Chart I visualizes the Education Field wise Attrition.<h4>
<h3>Step 6:- Donut</h3>
<h4>In Donut I visualize Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Group.<h4>
<h2>Final Result</h2>
